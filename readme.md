Quentin's Code Challenge Solution
=================================

*Note: This is an evolving document currently. I want to make this an* ideal *solution to the code challenge, something that can be used as a basis for validating other challenges. Becuase of this, I want to go beyond just "getting the job done".*

Running the Code
----------------
This is coded in python3 and requires (aside from corelibs), the [AWS IoT Python SDK](https://github.com/aws/aws-iot-device-sdk-python).

Once you've installed the requirements, you can run the code from terminal, with several options for arguments:

    -d / --debug / -v / --verbose
